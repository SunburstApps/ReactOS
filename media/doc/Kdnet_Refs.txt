References I used while implementing the KDNET protocol are as follows:

* https://github.com/Lekensteyn/kdnet
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection
* Files from Enterprise WDK ISO image

  * Download the ISO here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#enterprise-wdk-for-windows-10-version-1903-ewdk

The kdnet transport drivers (kd_??_????.dll) were adapted from the
device driver code already in ReactOS. All code in kdnet.dll is my own.
